## Data and Food Inequity

-   It is important to democratize and make accessible public data for public use
-   In Cincinnati, over 270,000 households are food insecure
-   The problem is deep and wide, with many negative outcomes among children

-   CoDEC is a data repository composed of equitable, community-level data for Cincinnati
-   This data can be accessed via the {codec} R package

# Shiny Implementation

## [CoDEC Data Explorer](https://grapph.shinyapps.io/codec_shiny) {background-image="codec_logo.svg" background-size="10%" background-position="top right"}

-   Built in Shiny, extensively using {bslib}, {leaflet} and {ggiraph}, we developed a data explorer so that public users can visualize different relationships across the various CoDEC data items

## [SAFE Dashboard](https://grapph.shinyapps.io/safe) {background-image="SAFE_logo.png" background-size="10%" background-position="top right"}

-   The SAFE stakeholders that contribute their meals provided data needed a public-facing dashboard to track overall meal coverage in Cincinnati neighborhoods
-   Built primarily using {bs4Dash} and {ggiraph}

## Successes

::: incremental
-   Built on the {codec} package, the CoDEC data explorer is a self-updating data tool that allows users to visualize a wide swath of public data
-   The SAFE dashboard provides previously non-existent data aggregation, standardization and visualization
-   All SAFE dashboard updates and feature additions are pulled from community stakeholders
