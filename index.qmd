# Background and Motivation

## Data Inequity

-   The White House’s Equitable Data Working Group has defined equitable data as “those that allow for rigorous assessment of the extent to which government programs and policies yield consistently fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals.”
- It is important to democratize public data for public use

## Food Inequity

- In Cincinnati, over 270,000 households are experiencing food insecurity
- The problem is deep and wide, and its impact broad, with negative effects on developmental, behavioral, academic, and emotional outcomes among children

## Community Data Explorer for Cincinnati {background-image=codec_logo.svg background-size="20%" background-position="top right"}

-   CoDEC is a data repository composed of equitable, community-level data for Cincinnati
-   Motivated by a desire to make community-level data more FAIR
-   This data can be described, curated, and checked against CoDEC specifications using the {codec} R package

# Shiny Implementation

## [CoDEC Data Explorer](https://grapph.shinyapps.io/codec_shiny)

- Built in Shiny, extensively using {bslib}, {leaflet} and {ggiraph}, we developed a data explorer so that public users can visualize different relationships across the various CoDEC data items

## [SAFE Dashboard](https://grapph.shinyapps.io/safe)

- The SAFE stakeholders needed a public-facing dashboard to track meal coverage in Cincinnati neighborhoods 
- Built primarily using {bs4Dash}, {leaflet} and {ggiraph}
- Monthly data updates that are manual for now, but moving toward automation

## Successes and Next Steps
::: {.incremental}
- Built on the {codec} package, the CoDEC data explorer is a self-updating data tool that allows users to visualize a wide swath of public data
- The SAFE dashboard provides previously non-existent data aggregation, standardization and visualization
- All SAFE dashboard updates and feature additions are pulled from community stakeholders
- Migrating both apps to Posit Connect with plans to build an automated data pipeline for the SAFE dashboard
